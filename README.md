# Web Application Security Specialist

## 👋 About Me

I’m a web security specialist 


## 🛠️ Core Competencies

| Domain | Expertise |
|--------|-----------|
| 🔍 Recon & Enumeration | Subdomain takeover, JS scraping, parameter mining, passive OSINT |
| 🧨 Exploitation | Advanced XSS (DOM, CSP bypass), SQLi to RCE, SSRF chaining, prototype pollution |
| 🔐 Authentication | JWT tampering, OAuth misconfig, SSO bypass, 2FA weaknesses |
| 🧱 Access Control | IDOR, privilege escalation, broken object-level auth |
| 🧬 Logic Flaws | Business logic abuse, race conditions, workflow manipulation |
| 🧰 Tooling | Burp Suite Pro, ffuf, Interactsh, nuclei, custom Python/Bash scripts |
| 📚 Methodologies | OWASP Top 10, Bug Bounty playbooks, PTES, MITRE ATT&CK (Web TTPs) |

## 🧪 What I Do

- Perform black-box and gray-box web application penetration tests  
- Hunt for vulnerabilities in production systems via bug bounty platforms  
- Build custom tools and payloads for fuzzing, bypassing, and chaining exploits  
- Analyze real-world breaches and write technical breakdowns  
- Collaborate with dev teams to triage and remediate critical issues  
- Stay ahead of the curve with bleeding-edge research and exploit development  

## 🧠 Research Interests

- CSP bypass techniques and browser quirks  
- SSRF → cloud metadata exfiltration (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Deserialization and template injection in modern frameworks  
- Web3 and smart contract attack surfaces  
- Supply chain attacks in frontend ecosystems (npm, CDN, etc.)  
- AI-assisted fuzzing and anomaly detection in web traffic  

## 📂 Sample Projects

- 🛠️ ReconCraft — Custom passive recon tool for JS scraping and endpoint extraction  
- 🧪 XSS Lab — Curated collection of real-world XSS vectors and CSP bypasses  
- 📖 BugWrite — Markdown-based reporting templates for clear, actionable vulnerability writeups  
- 🔍 AuthZ-Checklist — A practical checklist for testing authorization logic in modern web apps  

## 🧬 Philosophy

> “Security isn’t about paranoia — it’s about precision. I don’t just break things. I model how they fail.”

I believe the best security work comes from empathy: understanding how developers think, how users behave, and how attackers exploit the space in between.
